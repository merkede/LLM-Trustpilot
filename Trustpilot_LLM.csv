Sadia Amin,5 reviews,GB,5 days ago,"We had a burglaryWe had a burglaryWe had a burglary, door glass was broken and cupboard door hinge came off. The person who came to fix the door frame was asked to deal with the cupboard door hinge, despite him not being a carpenter. As a result in 5 days hinge came off. I called the company the relevant person was busy at that moment. One of the female staff member called me back and refused to speak to me that my number was not on the policy although my name was, and I dealt with the whole procedure from the time of the incident. All of a sudden they did not want to speak to me on my contact number. They called my husband and excused to mend the cupboard door! despite it being included in our insurance policy.

Sadie,1 review,GB,"Jan 31, 2024","If I could give zero stars I wouldIf I could give zero stars I would. First of all, it’s a joke that you have to call to cancel a renewal when you should be able to do it online. Secondly, it takes forever to get through no matter what time or day you call. And then finally when you get through they are absolutely horrible. Wanted to not renew. Found another provider with a very reasonable quote and couldn’t be bothered to haggle with Hastings to get it down. The guy that I got through to had the most disgusting manners. He said with the most patronising attitude, that I had not been fair with them by not allowing them the opportunity to give me a lower quote. He said especially after my details had dramatically changed when searching for quotes online. He said as a teacher I should know better than to lie and that it “would’ve been nice to have an honest conversation”. I’m not a teacher? And this line of interrogation came out of nowhere. Also details can change in a year pal. Marital status, employment, address, age, vehicle, number of dependants.. to name a few.

Rosemary,18 reviews,GB,"Jan 31, 2024","Never use this companyNever use this company.  We had had our car insurance with Hastings Direct (HD) for several years and made no claims.  Unfortunately our renewal came up just before we went on holiday to Namibia and our credit card on their records had expired.  Namibia is a desert country with very poor internet access.  We tried four different credit cards and a debit card to pay this insurance but World Pay wouldn't accept any of them.  We emailed HD., asking for an extention to pay, as the car was locked up in our garage and no one was driving it.  We received a reply from Sian saying 'I can see you have mentioned having issues making payment due to being out of the country - please call our Customer Service team as soon as possible.'  On returning to the UK we rang HD to pay the outstanding premium.  They took £78 .85 for cancelling the policy.  We didn't cancel it - they did.  They would not reactivate our policy nor create a new one.  So we were left to find another company, as soon as possible, so we could collect the dog.  Their mantra on all their communications is 'We are here to help'!  Clearly not the case.  We can't understand why they cancelled our account with them, that generated approximately £300 / year, for a one-off payment of less than £100.So our advice is to never use this company.

Put my premium up by £100 for renewal so cancelled it and told them I got a quote from money supermarket.Com for a £100 less from HASTINGS DIRECT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a joke outfit   ps avoid any insurance company that uses BVS (building valuation solutions) as a surveyor they basically side with insurance companies, back handers come to mind 🤔Date of experience: January 10, 2023","Topic Category: Insurance Company - Customer Service, Pricing
Themes: Unfair treatment, Lack of transparency in claims process, Miscommunication
Pain Point: The reviewer had a claim denied due to ""wear and tear"" assessment by Building Valuation Solutions (BVS), received an unexpected premium increase, and felt disloyalty was not rewarded.
Detailed Topic: The reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with their building insurance claim being rejected using the term 'wear and tear'. They were disappointed about the price increase during policy renewal and felt unappreciated for their long-term relationship with the insurer since no discount was provided despite their continued business.

The wanted £500 +  from me compared to to last years, £300 + How come I asked (again) Another year without claiming, ( always buy the cover) another year of proof I drive safely, & my car has depreciated in value another year... with my no claims bonus, you want another £200 more?  some please explain to me why?  I didn't get an answer as you can imagine.  Whilst talking to the guy, I scrolled through Go Compare, & had 21 quotes cheaper than the 'loyal customer' service, & the email reminder states, good reasons to stay with us.. Name me one Hastings!!!!   maybe use them for the first year? & hoe nothing happens.. but don't have auto renewal.

I notified them I was a carer to my 85 year old mother, and this had no effect in assisting me at all.

Pain Point: A customer with an accident and a premium policy was left stranded without assistance from the insurance company for nearly 5 weeks.
Detailed Topic: The customer reported that despite having a premium policy, they were unable to receive help from Hastings for over a month due to a broken number plate, which made their car undrivable. They also mentioned being a carer for an elderly person and the difficulty it caused them in visiting her. They noted poor communication, long wait times, and multiple redirections when trying to seek help. Despite submitting complaints and reaching out to social media,"

Themes: Communication, Valuation Dispute
Pain Point: Poor communication leading to dispute over car valuation during insurance claim process.

Paul Hildreth,6 reviews,GB,"Mar 21, 2022","Avoid Hastings Direct at all costs!Avoid Hastings Direct at all costs!In November 2021 my son bought a Golf R.

It still had the original screenwash and the barcode stickers on the shock absorbers.  It was absolutely immaculate - not a mark on it.  on top of that practically every single optional extra had been added.  Make no mistake, this was an immaculate, stunning, unique car.Barely 6 weeks after he bought it he was driving to work and a driver T-boned him, slamming into his side and pushing him into the hedge.

We rejected this (obviously) asked to see the valuation criteria, asked to see the valuation report and submitted evidence showing the true value of the car.  Any search showed that the minimum value was £27K for a car of this mileage and standard and as soon as 'panoramic sunroof' was added the minimum price was £30K.Hastings came back with a revised valuation of approx £24.6K - still laughable and insuting.  Then there was a long delay as we submitted more evidence, and asked again for the valuation report and criteria.  In the end my son had the courtesy car longer than he had the Golf.  Finally Hastings said their valuation was final and if it wasn't accepted within 24 hours they would return the wreck to him and he would have to start the process all over again with his own insurance company.

Robyn ,2 reviews,GB,35 minutes ago,"Amazing until you have an accident.Used the app to notify them of an accident, the app is confusing, asks you if your going to claim for damage, doesn't explain that they'll take over. Without anyone from Hastings contacting they pass you straight over to enterprise to arrange the repair and arrange a hire car. I was first told that the Panel repairer i had chosen may not be suitable because they weren't a preferred repairer for them, my repairer would need to agree to their terms and rates, if not it was off to someone else, even though the cost would be paid by the third party. My right to choose my repair company apparently didn't matter to them.I got offered a two door fiat 500. I rang to tell them this wouldn't work for me, i needed a like for like of my vehicle or something of a similar nature. Long story short, No because we don't want to foot the bill.

Costin Banescu,3 reviews,GB,A day ago,"Poor Customer Service and hardly any communicationThe car insurance policy I have bought involved a tab connected via the app to my phone to allow some monitoring. I could not connect the app to the tab and have reported that by email and phone. I was promised the policy would not be canceled!

Hastings does not provide even a single email address to allow communication (but they have multiple choices of communication- an app - where they provide a phone number where they can keep customers waiting on the line).

Theme(s): Communication Issues, Long Wait Times
Pain Point: Inability to connect app to device led to long wait times on phone calls with unresponsive customer service.
Detailed Topic: The insured faced issues connecting the app to a tab required for monitoring under his new car insurance policy. Multiple attempts through email and phone were made but no resolution was provided. Despite being assured the policy wouldn't be cancelled, it eventually was. Extended wait times during follow-up conversations ranged from 30 minutes to an hour. No email contact option exists with the company, making issue resolution more difficult.

Those repairs took 6 months and during the delay they offered to increase the compensation amount to £450 (they still haven't paid all of this at the time of writing 7th February 2024 and continue to claim they can't find the email that offered this, despite me sending the email chain back to them on multiple occasions). When they returned the car to me, it had numerous scratches to the bodywork that weren't there before the accident (the car had 150 miles on the clock at the time of the accident).

Aloisius Baker,4 reviews,GB,Updated 3 days ago,"Do they know what they are doing ?The policy was under a different name, George Parker.About one month before my policy was due for renewal I received an email from Julie Taylor at Hastings Direct saying that they would not be able to renew my policy. The slightly patronising email was full of waffle and no specific fact about the reason why. It mentioned my riding ability - I have full no claims discount and a clean license. The type of bike - I have had the same model for twenty years and where I live - a village in the South Downs National Park.I telephoned Hastings Direct and was connected instantly to a recorded message saying how sorry they were that they were unable to answer the telephone, it took them 10 minutes, only to be told that I was through to the wrong department, but I would be connected to the correct department, back to the recorded message saying how sorry they were that they could not answer the call. Another 10 minutes and the call was answered, but once again the wrong department and I would be connected to the correct department. Another 10 minutes listening to the recorded message of how sorry they were and then the call was answered. The lady was very sorry but she could not tell me exactly why my insurance was not being renewed, so after a few minutes of more waffle I ended the call.The email from Hastings Direct suggested that I use a comparison website to find an insurer who would be prepared to take the risk of insuring me. I did this with exactly the same details and the top suggestion was HASTINGS DIRECT  !!!‌Ref;  00211127364068   Needless to say I went with another insurer and had all the hassle of providing the information that they required, the premium I paid was no more than last year, which was a bonus.

Review: Do they know what they are doing ?The policy was under a different name, George Parker.About one month before my policy was due for renewal I received an email from Julie Taylor at Hastings Direct saying that they would not be able to renew my policy. The slightly patronising email was full of waffle and no specific fact about the reason why. It mentioned my riding ability - I have full no claims discount and a clean license. The type of bike - I have had the same model for twenty years and where I live - a village in the South Downs National Park.I telephoned Hastings Direct and was connected instantly to a recorded message saying how sorry they were that they were unable to answer the telephone, it took them 10 minutes, only to be told that I was through to the wrong department, but I would be connected to the correct department, back to the recorded message saying how sorry they were that they could not answer the call. Another 10 minutes and the call was answered, but once again the wrong department and I would be connected to the correct department. Another 10 minutes listening to the recorded message of how sorry they were and then the call was answered. The lady was very sorry but she could not tell me exactly why my insurance was not being renewed, so after a few minutes of more waffle I ended the call.The email from Hastings Direct suggested that I use a comparison website to find an insurer who would be prepared to take the risk of insuring me. I did this with exactly the same details and the top suggestion was HASTINGS DIRECT  !!!‌Ref;  00211127364068   Needless to say I went with another insurer and had all the hassle of providing the information that they required, the premium I paid was no more than last year, which was a bonus.                                 Once my insurance had expired I received a text from Hastings Direct ; 'Based on your recent experience with Hastings Direct, on a scale of 0 to 10 how likely are you to recommend us' !  You couldn't make it up. Perhaps Ms. Taylor would like to give the true reason for Hastings Direct refusing to Insure me.Date of experience: February 02, 2024","Topic Category: Customer Service

The policy commenced on July 21st, 2023, and I made the full payment upfront.On February 1st, 2024, you requested additional information from me. I promptly responded through your contact page but have not received any further communication from you directly. Instead, you have chosen to reply on this public platform.While I understand the need for verification procedures, I take strong objection to the threatening tone of your recent message. As all drivers are aware, operating a vehicle without valid insurance is strictly prohibited.

Review: ""Unacceptable Demands for Additional Information and Fees on Car Insurance Policy: Awaiting ResponseI am one and half year client of Hastings Direct, my insurance finishes in July but they ask for a copy of my driving licence, all V5C book and a recent bill for my address correction like I am a new client .Also they say if they want they can charge me for change of the insurance for £30 or £45 for cancellation.So they say they can collect all my information and make me pay AGAIN.....None of my friends (with different insurance companies) heard a thing like that!!!!  Dear Adam,I am writing in response to your recent communication regarding my car insurance policy, policy number [poliçe numarası]. As you are aware, I carefully reviewed and accepted the policy you sent me on July 4th, 2023. The policy commenced on July 21st, 2023, and I made the full payment upfront.On February 1st, 2024, you requested additional information from me. I promptly responded through your contact page but have not received any further communication from you directly. Instead, you have chosen to reply on this public platform.While I understand the need for verification procedures, I take strong objection to the threatening tone of your recent message. As all drivers are aware, operating a vehicle without valid insurance is strictly prohibited. However, your request for """"information update"""" suggests potential additional charges even if my information remains unchanged. This is unacceptable.For your reference","Category: Policy Terms
Themes: Unclear Communication, Threatening Tone, Request for Additional Charges
Pain Point: The customer was asked to provide additional documents and face potential extra fees despite being an existing customer.
Detailed Topic: The customer was not informed clearly about the reason behind the document requests and the possibility of extra costs which caused distress and confusion.
Main Emotion: Frustration
Emotion Explanation: The frustration arises due to poor communication from the company leading to unnecessary stress and financial uncertainty."

Hastings has turned from a decent insurance company to a company in decline with staff who don't understand English well and simply cancel your policies as their cba talking to you and make massive assumptions even about loyal customers.My final review on them as i wont be back! lost a 6 year old customer and nobody in my house or family will be using you again that's for sure, way you discriminated agaisn't me purely due to my age and lumping me into a bracket and assuming i must be a boy racer and will wrap it around a tree is disgraceful, happy to report i have had the car two days and its got 0 mods and isn't wrapped around  a tree 👍Date of experience: February 03, 2024",1,"Please provide the following information for the given review keeping concise to a single sentence where possible:

Had the black box and data was being sent like normal. Come the time of my insurance renewal I decided to stick with them and it proved to be a bad choice. They needed documents that was only asked of me after we spent a year together. There was a mistake with one and I was told I needed to pay them to fix this. After a half an hour of them not being able to justify this request for a payment, I didn’t have to pay it in the end. The next problem I had was when I received an email two days ago saying they cancelled my insurance due to no data being sent from my black box. I was confused and decided to ring up so I could understand what happened and I was met with an impatient woman who ended up shouting at me because I didn’t get why they cancelled. Not a great way to take care of your customers at all! The issue was they weren’t receiving any data from my black box, which I rang them about back in October and was told that they were Receiving data, but not enough. I told them I was in uni and would only be driving the weekends.

Not even a call or email to say hey tomorrow we are cancelling your insurance. They expect that every email they send would be received by me, that is unrealistic especially in this day and age. They told me they sent 5 emails, I only remember seeing 1. By the way, paid for the year and they did say they will send a refund for the remaining months of my insurance.

Graham Roos,7 reviews,GB,"Updated Feb 1, 2024","Rude and unhelpfulRude and unhelpful. I have my car insurance and my main home insurance with Hastings but i will not be renewing with them. I have a second property as I divide my time between my main address in London and my flat  just outside Sheffield as it is often a better place for me to work (I am a writer film maker). I tried to use the app to get insurance for the second property but it wouldn’t register even though there is an option for 2nd property. Today I called a representative who literally just laughed at me down the phone and said we wont give you insurance for a second home and NO ONE will. He was gleeful and rude and patronising. He said you can’t divide your time - you can only apply for landlords  insurance for a second home but then it has to be rented out.

Review: Rude and unhelpfulRude and unhelpful. I have my car insurance and my main home insurance with Hastings but i will not be renewing with them. I have a second property as I divide my time between my main address in London and my flat  just outside Sheffield as it is often a better place for me to work (I am a writer film maker). I tried to use the app to get insurance for the second property but it wouldn’t register even though there is an option for 2nd property. Today I called a representative who literally just laughed at me down the phone and said we wont give you insurance for a second home and NO ONE will. He was gleeful and rude and patronising. He said you can’t divide your time - you can only apply for landlords  insurance for a second home but then it has to be rented out. I told him he was not being helpful and he just laughed and told me no one would insure me. They have lost me as a customer as I simply wont renew with them.

Pain Point: Unsatisfactory treatment during insurance claim process leading to dissatisfaction with the company.
Detailed Topic: Longstanding customer was expecting a better replacement car option due to their loyalty and good driving record but received a Fiat 500 instead of their Citroen C4 which they believed was unjustified based on the circumstances and their past relationship with the insurer.
Main Emotion: Disappointment
Emotion Explanation: The disappointment stems from feeling undervalued as a longstanding customer despite having maintained a clean driving record and high NCD. This feeling"
Dan Paxton,2 reviews,GB,"Jan 30, 2024","Live and learn from my experiencesHastings business plan is straightforward. Offer cheap insurance and then sting you with amendments once the policy is in force. If you take out a policy with Hastings then ensure that every minute detail is correct or they will charge you an amendment fee plus a £30 admin fee. If you bought your car sometime in June 2015 then you’d better check the exact date on the V5 because when they ask for a copy of it and you’ve not put the correct date then they will charge you to change it. I’ve never had issues with other insurers, nor have I been asked to send copies of the V5, driving licences etc. Another thing to watch out for is them auto-renewing your policy and informing you via an email to your junk box, then cancelling it through ‘non-payment’ and charging an admin fee for the pleasure of nothing.

Matthew Palusiak,22 reviews,GB,"Jan 29, 2024","Disgusting tactics to overcharge loyal customersAfter recently changing one of our cars, I went online to make the necessary changes to my wife’s policy with Hastings Direct. Upon entering the details, I was met with an unwelcome quote of an additional £102 (plus £20 admin fee), on top of the already outrageous quote we were paying for the year. For context, my wife’s insurance in the previous year was between £600-700, come time to renew in  October 2023, Hastings wanted a total of £1,696 when paying monthly. After searching online and presenting cheaper, like for like quotes to Hastings, my wife managed to get the price down to £1,201. I could still barely stomach this price given her insurance has been around half of that for the previous 7/8 years, but I was also aware that insurance has gone up across the board and accepted it as the best price we would get. However, what I can not stomach with Hastings was the previously mentioned £102 increase to swap vehicles, especially since we were swapping to a vehicle that, on paper, should be considerably cheaper, and as it turns out, it is because I searched online and found a quote as new customer from Hastings for £816, better still, I found a cheaper quote at another company for £717.

Mya x,1 review,GB,"Jan 28, 2024","I HAD A CRASH THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT AND NOW I AM LEFT WORSE OF! part 1This review/claim is very long and messy. will have to post in two parts, other part will be posted with same title. On the 29th of September i had a non fault accident. I was rear ended, this is where this claim began. -20th of November is when they  took my car. Same day i was provided a curtesy car, at the hire company i was told i could pay a 70 pound fee to cover my excess if i was to have an accident being my fault, this did confuse me as Hastings told me they would cover all costs that came up. However since the accident wasn’t my fault i wasn’t paying anything else so i thought id pay just to cover my back and left it at that. 2 days later the hire company called me to say that the person who gave me the hire car made a mistake, and gave me the wrong car because it didn’t match my car enough so they weren’t able to insure me on it. (My car is a 1.4 litre ibiza, they gave me a 1.4 corsa but then swapped it for a 1 litre fiat 500) now this wasn’t a problem, mistakes happen, it wasn’t my permanent car so i happily went down and swapped it. Now whilst i was down they informed me that they would have to refund me some of the 70 pound fee as they couldn’t cover my excess anymore and that i would have to pay an  1000 pound excess for anything from a crash to a popped tyre. Now, i then took this up with Hastings, at this point i wasn’t annoyed at Hastings as this may have been information that they didn’t know. So i spoke to someone at Hastings, they said they would provide me with a different company who would give me a curtsey car and passed my details on to them, i then received a call from this place and they told me the same thing, my excess would be £1000 pound. The only reason this bothered me was because my own excess is £150 pound, so why am i driving around in a car with the worry of a £1000 pound excess over a crash that wasn’t my fault. I then decided just to leave it as i thought i was only going to have this car for a couple of weeks. Now i know this isn’t all Hastings fault, but i feel like this plays a part in showing the lack of communication. -Throughout November and December, i was mislead, every phone call with Hastings i was told a different story, i made numerous contacts with the garage they told me that they were waiting for Hastings to confirm, send, sign paperwork. Now when i thought i was getting somewhere, on the 22nd of December a few days before Hastings closed for Christmas i got a call from Hastings telling me they hadn't started any work yet at the garage and wanted to hear how the crash happened. -Last week i got an email from Hastings, they had come to the conclusion that my car was a “total loss” and a Cat N. I was  baffled by this, i was rear ended and needed minor body work fixing. So they offered me 2 options, to have a full pay out and they keep the car, or to have a part pay out and i keep the car. Although i was baffled by the fact it took them from November to last week to make this decision, my car was absolutely fine to drive when i gave it them so I decided i would keep my car and get it repaired myself, to be honest I just wanted this whole claim to be over with due to the amount of stress that came with an accident that was not my fault. In this email they also included i had 2 days to return my hire vehicle or i would be charged. As soon as I received this email, i called them to let them know i wanted to keep it and they said i could go pick my car up the next day. -The following day, i called the garage to let them know i was coming to get my car, they told me that my car was stripped as they were under the impression from Hastings that i was not keeping my car. I told them that i was and they said they couldn’t do anything until Hastings confirmed that with them. So i said i would call Hastings to tell them to pass this information on. I called Hastings and they said that they was sending the information over, and i also asked if they could extend my curtesy car which they agreed a couple of days passed and i called the garage, 1 to ask if they had heard anything from hastings, and 2 to just get some reassurance my car would be in the same condition as it was when i took it. They informed me that Hastings still hadnt made any communication and that they was unsure if my car would be roadworthy . So i called hastings back, and this point i was very stressed with this all, i was on hold for 30 minutes whilst the man from Hastings called the garage. He came back with my car will be ready the end of next week and that they are going to try to make my car roadworthy.

I then decided just to leave it as i thought i was only going to have this car for a couple of weeks. Now i know this isn’t all Hastings fault, but i feel like this plays a part in showing the lack of communication. -Throughout November and December, i was mislead, every phone call with Hastings i was told a different story, i made numerous contacts with the garage they told me that they were waiting for Hastings to confirm, send, sign paperwork. Now when i thought i was getting somewhere, on the 22nd of December a few days before Hastings closed for Christmas i got a call from Hastings telling me they hadn't started any work yet at the garage and wanted to hear how the crash happened. -Last week i got an email from Hastings, they had come to the conclusion that my car was a “total loss” and a Cat N. I was  baffled by this, i was rear ended and needed minor body work fixing. So they offered me 2 options, to have a full pay out and they keep the car, or to have a part pay out and i keep the car. Although i was baffled by the fact it took them from November to last week to make this decision, my car was absolutely fine to drive when i gave it them so I decided i would keep my car and get it repaired myself, to be honest I just wanted this whole claim to be over with due to the amount of stress that came with an accident that was not my fault. In this email they also included i had 2 days to return my hire vehicle or i would be charged. As soon as I received this email, i called them to let them know i wanted to keep it and they said i could go pick my car up the next day. -The following day, i called the garage to let them know i was coming to get my car, they told me that my car was stripped as they were under the impression from Hastings that i was not keeping my car. I told them that i was and they said they couldn’t do anything until Hastings confirmed that with them. So i said i would call Hastings to tell them to pass this information on. I called Hastings and they said that they was sending the information over, and i also asked if they could extend my curtesy car which they agreed a couple of days passed and i called the garage, 1 to ask if they had heard anything from hastings, and 2 to just get some reassurance my car would be in the same condition as it was when i took it. They informed me that Hastings still hadnt made any communication and that they was unsure if my car would be roadworthy . So i called hastings back, and this point i was very stressed with this all, i was on hold for 30 minutes whilst the man from Hastings called the garage. He came back with my car will be ready the end of next week and that they are going to try to make my car roadworthy.
